    "answer": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking about the laptop reimbursement policy. Let me check the context provided.\n\nFirst, the eligibility: only full-time employees who have completed their probation period are eligible. So I need to mention that. \n\nNext, approved models. They can only purchase from the IT department's approved list, unless they get special approval. That's important to note. \n\nReimbursement amount is up to 75,000 rupees. Any amount beyond that is the employee's responsibility. I should include that limit. \n\nSubmission process: the context says \"Employees\" but it's cut off. Maybe the user expects me to mention that they need to follow the submission steps, but since the context is incomplete, I should stick to the info given. \n\nSo, putting it all together: eligibility, approved models, reimbursement amount. The submission process isn't fully detailed here, so maybe the answer should focus on the parts provided. The user might be looking for a concise summary of the policy. Let me structure the answer clearly with each section.\n</think>\n\nOur laptop reimbursement policy is outlined as follows:  \n\n1. **Eligibility**: Full-time employees who have completed their probation period are eligible for reimbursement.  \n2. **Approved Models**: Employees must purchase laptops from the IT department's approved list.
